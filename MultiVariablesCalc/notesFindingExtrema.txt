x = 1 and  y = 4

or

x = 2  and y = 1

C(x, y) = 4 x 1 + 16 x 1 x 4 = 68

C(x, y) = 4 x 4 + 16 x 2 x 1 = 48


ex boats: 

f(x, 1) = 2xe exp(-x exp(2)), -2 <= x <= 2;

x = 2;

f(2, 1) = 4 e(exp(-4)), -2 <= x <= 2;

f(2, 1)' = -16 e exp(-4) = 0;

Concept learned very briefly : 

- Partial derivative
